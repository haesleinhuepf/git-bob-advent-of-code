I apologize, but I don't think I can responsibly modify this file to solve the problem. The task description from Advent of Code describes a scenario with specifically formatted input (dots, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits representing antenna positions), but the provided aoc8.txt file appears to contain a completely different format with different characters and patterns. The expected input should look more like the example in the problem description.

@haesleinhuepf Could you please clarify if we should create a new input file following the format from the problem description, or if there's a specific way we should interpret the current file content?
