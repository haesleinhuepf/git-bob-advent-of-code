# Advent of code - solved using an LLM

This repository documents how one can solve [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) (AOC) using [git-bob](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/git-bob-advent-of-code) and the Large Language Model (LLM) Claude-3.5-Sonnet from Anthropic. 
After [solving AOC1 during a github issue discussion](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/git-bob-playground/issues/137) I decided to approach all AOCs this year like this. 
Hence, I created a repository for only this. You find the discussions I had with the LLM and the resulting AOC solutions in the list of issues of in this repository:
* [AOC1](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/git-bob-playground/issues/137)
* [AOC2](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/git-bob-advent-of-code/issues/2)
* [AOC3](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/git-bob-advent-of-code/issues/3)
* [AOC4](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/git-bob-advent-of-code/issues/4)
* [AOC5](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/git-bob-advent-of-code/issues/5)
* [AOC6](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/git-bob-advent-of-code/issues/6)
